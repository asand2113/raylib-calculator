# raylib-calculator
## Overview
A basic calculator that I created to learn the raylib library. This application is also a good starting project for people beginning to learn raylib to look over for educational purposes.

Make is used to build the program.

Raylib must be installed to build the program, which can be found at: www.raylib.com/
## Files
```
- Makefile : Used by Make to build/remove the program
- main.c : The program's primary control code and logic
- button.c : Code relating to the logic and control of the calculator's buttons
- button.h : The header file containing all of the information regarding the calculator buttons
```
